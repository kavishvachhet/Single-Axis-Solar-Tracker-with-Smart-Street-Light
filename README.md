## README for Single-Axis Solar Tracker with Smart Street Light  

### **Introduction**

The **Single-Axis Solar Tracker with Smart Street Light** is a smart outdoor lighting solution that integrates solar energy optimization with adaptive street illumination. This prototype combines a solar tracker mechanism with intelligent lighting systems to maximize the utilization of solar energy.

#### **Main Features**:

- **Solar Tracking**:  
  The system uses a single-axis mechanism to adjust the solar panel's position, ensuring it remains aligned with the sun throughout the day to capture maximum sunlight and optimize energy generation.

- **Smart Lighting**:  
  The streetlights powered by the harvested solar energy automatically activate at night. The system intelligently manages the lighting based on available energy:
  - **All lights turn on** when there is sufficient energy.
  - **Alternate lights activate** during low-energy conditions to conserve power.

- **Energy Management**:  
  The **Arduino UNO** controls the entire system, balancing energy usage between solar tracking and smart lighting efficiently.

#### **Problem Solved**:
This prototype addresses the need for sustainable and energy-efficient outdoor lighting, especially in areas with limited or costly power supply. By combining solar energy optimization with adaptive lighting, it reduces energy waste and provides a reliable, eco-friendly solution for outdoor illumination under diverse environmental conditions.
